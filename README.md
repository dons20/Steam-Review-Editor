# Steam Review Editor

## Introduction

Steam Review Editor is a simple but useful utility to help reviewers to write, format and preview their reviews before they publish them officially. It shows you at a glance, the formatting options that Steam support on their platform, allowing you to be extra creative when writing, instead of trying to memorize complex syntax.
